The Enigma Machine Simulator

	My project is to build an enigma machine simulator. The project has four classes: ‘Rotor’, 'Reflector' which extends the Rotor class, 'EnigmaMachine', 'EnigmaStimulator'. EnigmaMachine contains the algorithm for encrypting, which could encrypt a single letter or read in an entire file for encrypting. The EnigmaStimulator class is the one that generates the GUI. 

	To run my program, compile all of the four files and then run the EnigmaStimulator class. You will then see a JFrame window is created. On the top of the window, you can choose different rotors and reflectors as well as set the rotors and reflectors in different positions. The bottom keyboard is for you type in input letter. The middle keyboard will reflect the encryption. The checkbox “convert a whole file” in the top panel will enable you to convert an entire (plain text) file at the same time. To use that, you need to put your input file same folder with the .java and .class files. The output file will be created in the same file too.
